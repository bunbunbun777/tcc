  abstract = {The availability of low-cost hardware such as CMOS cameras and microphones
	has fostered the development of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks
	(WMSNs), i.e., networks of wirelessly interconnected devices that
	are able to ubiquitously retrieve multimedia content such as video
	and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data from the
	environment. In this paper, the state of the art in algorithms, protocols,
	and hardware for wireless multimedia sensor networks is surveyed,
	and open research issues are discussed in detail. Architectures for
	WMSNs are explored, along with their advantages and drawbacks. Currently
	off-the-shelf hardware as well as available research prototypes for
	WMSNs are listed and classified. Existing solutions and open research
	issues at the application, transport, network, link, and physical
	layers of the communication protocol stack are investigated, along
	with possible cross-layer synergies and optimizations.},

  abstract = {Wireless microsensor networks have been identified as one of the most
	important technologies for the 21st century. This paper traces the
	history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades,
	including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research
	Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor
	Networks (DSN) and the Sensor Information Technology (SensIT) programs.
	Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks
	are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security,
	habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical
	challenges in sensor network development include network discovery,
	control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing,
	tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting
	some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including
	localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking
	in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using
	local agents.},
